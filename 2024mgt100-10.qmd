# Marketing+Finance

- Customer-based corporate valuation

- CBCV using credit card expenditure panels

- Asset price game

- Wrapping up


## Hi Finance, I'm Marketing

- Finance/marketing crossovers

      - Marketing policy effects on stock prices
      - ROI estimates & budgets (ads, sales, product launch, ...)
      - Customer opportunity evaluations & financial forecasts
      - M&A analyses, complementarities & market impacts
      - Behavioral finance AKA acknowledging that investors are humans and therefore subject to biases
      
- Yet disciplinary cultures differ

- Current areas of opportunity 

::: notes
- We're going to do some maths today, lots of symbols but only elementary operations
- then we'll look at some case studies
:::


## *Corporate Valuation* 
- Quantitative current valuation of a business 

      - True valuation, like wtp, is inherently subjective bc future is unknown
      - Yet we often need to assess value without a full sale, eg investment advice, M&A, settling a lawsuit, IPO pricing, approving a business loan

- Theoretical best way to measure: sell x\% at auction

      - But how does valuation changes with x?
      - Tough experiment to run, but demand usually slopes down

- CorpVal: Develops, applies models to value businesses 

      - Inherently stochastic, but ideally closer to appraisal than speculation
      - Do results depend on who pays? Buyer, seller, 3rd party
      
::: notes
- Corporate valuation is its own field
- something something "Gamestop"
:::


## Standard CorpVal Formulas

$$Shareholder Value_T=OA_T+NOA_T-ND_T$$

- $T$ indicates current expectation given *T*oday's data 
- $OA_T$ is net present value of Operating Assets
- $NOA_T$ is npv of Non-Operating Assets
- $ND_T$ is net debt

::: notes
- NOA_T : e.g. cash holdings, crypto, investments in other businesses, value of patents, ...
- Net Debt = Funds owed - funds lent
- Source: Investment Valuation by Damodaran (2012)
- Let's zoom in on OA_T
:::



## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model {.smaller}

$$
OA_T=\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\frac{FCF_{T+t}}{(1+WACC_T)^t}
$$

- $WACC$ is the weighted average cost of capital
- $FCF$ is Free cash flow, or net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) minus change in capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization (D&A), minus change in nonfinancial working capital ($\Delta$NFWC):

$$
FCF_t=NOPAT_t-(CAPEX_t-D\&A_t)-\Delta NFWC_t
$$

::: notes
- Source: Investment Valuation by Damodaran (2012)
:::



## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model 

$$
    NOPAT_t=[Rev_t*(1-AVC_t)-FC_t]*(1-TR_t)
$$    

- $Rev$ is revenue
- $AVC$ is average variable cost
- $FC$ is fixed cost
- $TR$ is corporate tax rate

::: notes
- Finally, a profit function!
:::

## Is this the best way? 

- Traditionally, analysts predict NOPAT based on past NOPAT:

  $$
  NOPAT_T = f(\{NOPAT_{T-t}\}_{t=1,...,T})
  $$ 

- Can we do better? Enter CBCV

        - Start w subscription biz, since rev/cust is roughly constant

::: notes
- Of course, subscription businesses have tiers, discounts, etc.; ignore for simplicity
- Extensible to non-subscription biz, but more moving pieces
:::

## Core CBCV Idea {.smaller}

- Firm strategies can be described with two attributes:

  1. Promote well: High customer acquisition, High CAC, high churn
    
          - Tends to be expensive 
          - Requires a large market to sustain (why?)
    
  2. Retain well: High retention, higher CLV, low CAC 

          - Tends to be higher $OA_T$, but slower acquisition (why?)

- Customer data improve $NOPAT_t$ forecasts by distinguishing promotion from retention, & better predict future churn

      - Intentionally simplified. A biz could both promote & retain well, or neither

- Hence we should assume

$$
NOPAT_T = f(\{ACQ_{T-t},RET_{T-t}\}_{t=1,...,T})
$$


## The C(.,.) Matrix {.smaller}

- Let $C(t,t')$ be the number of customers acquired in time $t$ & still active in time $t'\ge t$
  
    - Firm can count customers $C(t,t')$ for all pairs $(t<T,t'<T)$

            - Sophisticated companies monitor these data internally

    - $C(t,t)$ is simply customers acquired in period $t$
    - $C(t,t')$ is weakly decreasing in $t'$
    - $C(.,t)$ is all customers active at time $t$
    
           - roughly proportional to $NOPAT_t$

    - $C(.,t)-C(.,t-1)$ is attrition at time $t$


- Public firms report profits quarterly. CBCV advocates public reporting of 

    - customer acquisition by cohort
    - customer attrition by cohort

::: notes

-  Source: McCarthy et al *Journal of Marketing 2017
:::


## What about transaction businesses?

- CBCV extends to non-subscription  businesses, but 

      - Customer attrition not directly observed
      - Purchase frequency varies across customers & time
      - Spending varies across customers & time
      - Cross-selling opportunities and takeup vary across customers & time

- Greater variance and model uncertainty, <br>hence forecasts are more uncertain

## Blue Apron in 2017

![](images/blueapron1.jpg){fig-align=center width=6in}

::: notes 
- [Source: WSJ on Blue Apron Financials, pre-IPO](https://web.archive.org/web/20201112043423/https://www.wsj.com/articles/stir-fry-on-sale-blue-apron-turns-to-deals-to-draw-customers-1498561202)
- This isn't showing all C(t,t') data, but marketing is a HUGE % of revenue, and rising proportionally with total customers. McCarthy pointed out in social media that's very likely unsustainable.
- This is an example of a high-CAC, low-retention business. 25\% is incredibly high. 1-10% is more typical
- Note also that CAC was rising: Somewhat akin to the "pump and dump" trading strategy. Using new investor money to increasingly acquire new customers, but neglected retention
::: 


## Blue Apron in 2019

![](images/blueapron2.png){fig-align=center width=7in}

::: notes 
- Sadly, after IPO at $32 in march 2018, and a peak at $58 in July 2018, the stock reached $.70 in 2023, a loss of 98% from IPO valuation
- Dan was right, despite this being a new category and inherently uncertain to predict
- This was an early "win" for CBCV
- [Source: Motley Fool in 2019    ](https://web.archive.org/web/20210228221306/https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/03/28/lyfts-ipo-the-one-article-you-need-to-read.aspx)
::: 


## Credit card expenditure panels 

- Anonymous credit card expenditure data: Report 

      - Anonymous card ID
      - Merchant ID
      - Spend, timestamp, location, merchant category

- Data are anonymized, but data fusion enables stochastic reidentification

- Powerful implications for CBCV: 

      - You no longer need internal data to estimate C(t,t')
      - Investors can mine CC data for customer insights
  
::: notes 
- Let's look at some case studies of privately held corporations
- AKA not publicly traded stocks

## Instacart Gross Order Value

![](images/instacart_gov.png){fig-align=center width=7in}


![](images/logo-instacart.png){fig-align=right width=1in}


::: notes 
- GOV: roughly proportional to revenue
- Notice how smoothly GOV changed from 2017-20
- What happened in 2020-March?
- Working with a totally different data source here: credit card expendtiure panels with millions of consumers from Earnest Research

::: notes 
- Now, let's look under the hood at C(.,.)
- Again, notice how smoothly Instacart retention changed from 2017-20
- But, retention was trending down from 2017-20 as more stores started delivering
- You can see that Instacart retention rose during the pandemic
- Investors could translate that retention increase to firm value

- Again, notice how smoothly Doordash GOV changed from 2017-20. Builds confidence in using past retention to predict future retention
- Unlike Instacart, Doordash retention was trending up from 2017-20
- Pandemic goosed GOV, but then it resumed trend

## CBCV rollout

- CBCV is *slowly* entering finance & accounting canon

        - Firms increasingly experiment with reporting customer metrics (ThetaCLV)
        - Firms with high retention self-select into reporting it
        - Numerous firms have customer-level data available for reporting

- Prediction: A tipping point 

        - Should incentivize start-ups toward customer retention 
        - Should make capital allocation more efficient 
        - But, won't happen until enough investors demand it

::: notes  
- Like econ, Finance & accounting worlds are famously conservative and slow to adopt
- Fader & McCarthy are on their second related start-up to popularize CBCV, having sold the first one to Nike
- when enough firms report customer-level metrics, then the ones that don't should be seen as low quality investments
- Ofc, lots of investors still buy low-quality investments
- Currently, customer acquisition is overemphasized by many investors
:::


## Asset Price Game

- You are VCs trading start-up shares ("assets")

- Each team starts with 3 assets and $20 cash

- Teams can make money in 1 of 3 ways:

  1. Collect dividends
  2. Buy and sell assets
  3. Asset payouts at the end of the game
  
- Richest team at the end gets extra credit

- Play in teams of 5 : Form now & appoint a speaker

## Trading rounds

- We will play $n$ 2-minute rounds. Within each round :

1. Trade assets/money in double Walrasian auction
2. After trading, each asset pays its owning team $1 dividend
3. After dividend, each asset goes bankrupt with 1/6 probability

After $n$th round, every surviving asset pays an extra $6

## Trading {.smaller .scrollable}

4 allowable trading statements: 

1. State a selling price: "Team (w) ASKS $a.bc" 
2. State a buying offer: "Team (x) BIDS $d.ef" 
3. Accept a selling price: "Team (y) ACCEPTS Team (w)'s ask"
4. Accept a buying offer: "Team (z) ACCEPTS Team (x)'s bid" 

Rules:

- No more than 1 ASK or BID per team per round
- No ASK more than the lowest open ask (why?)
- No BID less than the highest open bid
- You can only ask/bid/accept if you have the asset or cash to cover
- We track all trades; you track your own assets, payouts and cash by round
    - [Copy this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eAmIIGBdTgFCLXxy03NW4gLl2uah1c6tnMc6GfmRn3w/edit?usp=sharing); let's walk through it
- Raise your hand to ask/bid/accept

- Any questions?

# Wrapping up



## Modeling: 1000' view

- *Model*: Simple representation of complicated phenomena

          - We can't fully understand the phenomena
          - We can fully understand the model, but even this can be hard

- Modeling is a superpower!

          - You can understand, explain and predict things that others can't
          - Modeling skills develop with practice & transfer across domains
          
- Cautions

          - Simple models are often 85-95% effective
          - There is never a true model: "Model uncertainty" is always present
          - Never mistake the model for the phenomena
          - It's "a" model, not "your" model
          - All models assume; good models assume transparently
          - If it were true, we wouldn't call it an "assumption"
          - Anyone can tear down a model; improving a model is work

<!--Beginners often say: "my model," "my data," "my assumptions"... -->
<!-- Modeling for the sake of modeling might be fun; might increase your modeling skill level; but it does not tell you about the world, and generally won't interest others-->


## Homework 

- No assignment or quiz

- Chat briefly about the final

![](images/homework.jpg){fig-align="right" width=4in}

## Congrats you did it!

![](images/girl-celebrates.png){fig-align="center" width=6in}

- Special congratulations for those who are graduating

          - It's a big deal. We're proud of you.

## Recap

- Corporate valuation uses past profits to predict future profits, without using granular customer metrics
- Customer-Based Corporate Valuation (CBCV) advocates reporting $C(t,t')$ to enable investors to better predict profits
- CBCV is still small but growing, there are opportunities here
- Fundamentals help calculate asset prices
- No customers, no business
