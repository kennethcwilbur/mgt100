::: notes
- This paper was published several years before even I was born
- It has been cited 11,000 times. Probably the most cited paper in marketing
- One of the first predictive analytics papers published in any business discipline
- This is a differential equation model, in which the change in a function modeled as a function of the level of the function
- Model was borrowed from epidemiology
- Performs well, but not overall, only relative to all other failed attempts to predict the future

## Importance of Customer Acquisition 

-   [Einav et al.
    (2021)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29561/w29561.pdf)
    analyzed all US Visa CC transaction data

        - >$1T spent in 32B transactions by 428MM cards at 1MM stores from 2016-19
        - Assume card~=customer 

$\text{BrandRev.} = \sum spend \equiv \sum \frac{stores}{1} \frac{cards}{stores} \frac{transactions}{cards} \frac{spend}{transactions}$

-   Research question: How well does each factor explain brand 
    revenue?

-   Regressed log revenue on log RHS with merchant and year fixed
    effects

## 

![](images/einav,etal2021a.png){fig-align="center" width="7in"}

::: notes
-   Row B is the most representative and controls for merchant dummies
    and year dummies
-   Compare column 2 to other columns: ( \# unique customers / store )
    explains 68-84% of variation in merchant revenue
-   Far more than other variables
:::

## 

![](images/einav,etal2021b.png){fig-align="center" width="7.5in"}

::: notes
-   Similar finding across merchant types
-   Remarkably consistent across sectors. These numbers are above 70pct
    bc it's a subsample of offline retailers
-   Explains why companies focus more on customer-level metrics than
    store, visit or transaction level metrics
:::

## Customer Revenue Metrics

-   Market size: How many customers might purchase?
-   Diffusion: How does the served market change over time?
-   CLV: How profitable are customer relationships?

::: notes
-   Until now, we have taken the perspective of a dispassionate
    economist or market analyst. But, most customer analytics work
    happens inside firms. Let's consider how you look at the market when
    you're inside a company.
:::

## Market Size

-   Market size ($N$): \# of people who might pay to address the core
    need in a given time period

        - Alternatively measured in $, units or volume
        - Noisy but helps inform potential returns to investments 
        - Typical investor's first question: How big is the market?
          $100B market is viewed differently than a $100MM market
        - How will you know if you got the right answer?
        - What happens if you overestimate market size?

-   "Marketing myopia:" Neglecting nontraditional competitors, e.g.
    Zoom v. Uber or Carnival v. Whistler

::: notes
-   Market size counts both purchasers and non-purchasers
-   The idea would be that for people who have a core need to work, they
    might alternately use Uber to work in an office, or Zoom to work
    from home; hence Uber and Zoom compete
-   How will the investor react if your market size estimate sounds off?
    Some might proceed anyway; some might immediately pass, figuring
    they can't trust you; some might want to dive into the details to
    see if you know something they don't, or if you have solid math
    backing up your claims
:::

## Market Size

-   3 ways to estimate:
    -   "Top Down" Total Addressable Market (TAM) : <br>How many people
        have the core need?
    -   "Bottom up" Served Available Market (TAM): <br>How many people currently
        pay to solve the core need?
        -   TAM=SAM+Unserved
    -   Analyst estimates
-   Best practice: Use all three, triangulate, gauge sensitivity

## Case study: US Mattress Market

-   USA population : \~340 million

-   Assumption : $TAM\approx SAM$ (why? pros, cons?)

-   Assumption : Avg mattress lasts 7 years (pros, cons?)

-   Market size $\approx$ 47.1 million people annually

-   Average mattress price : \$283, across all bed sizes

-   Market size $\approx$ \$13.3B/year

-   Let's check [Grand View
    Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/mattress-market)
    &
    [ISPA](https://sleepproducts.org/resources/statistics/industry-sales-data/)

::: notes
-   Consider 2nd homes & hotels vs. homeless population
-   How much do those analyst reports cost?
-   What are analyst incentives? How should they price? How often should
    they update their estimates?
:::

## Diffusion curves

![](images/diffusion_evidence.png){fig-align="center" width="10in"}

::: notes
-   There are claims that diffusion curves are speeding up in recent
    years. That may be consistent with social media and generally
    accelerating information diffusion
-   Consider product complementarities, eg electricity + TV, or
    substitution between products, eg telephone + cellphone
::: 

##

![](images/timeto100musers.jpg) 

::: notes
- Important: these products are not randomly selected, they are intentionally selected to make a point
- Of course there remain many technology products with slow adoption. Think about robot vacuums, time-lapse or other phone peripherals, etc etc etc 
- But there does seem to be something to the idea that social media has the potential to dramatically accelerate diffusion for some "winning" products
:::

## New Products by Year

![](images/npbyyear.png){fig-align="center" width=7in}

::: notes
- For completeness we should consider the full scope of products launched every year
- Even if we limit ourselves to food & drug channels, it's massive, on the order of 35-40k new SKUs launched in a typical year
- 90-95% fail completely within 6 months, as in revenues go to zero and manufacturer withdraws the product (Wilbur & Farris 2014)
- Unfortunately USDA stopped updating these data publicly, probably because Mintel increased price too much
:::

## Predicting Diffusion: [Bass (1969)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_diffusion_model)

-   $M$ : Market size (we'll estimate this)

-   $t$ : Time periods

-   $A(t)$ : Accumulated sales before time $t$

        - AKA "installed base"
        - A(0)=0 by assumption

-   $\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$ : number of new adopters in time $t$

-   $R(t)$ : Remaining customers who have yet to adopt,
    $R(t)\equiv M-A(t)$

::: notes
-   Can you see where we're going? DiffEQ using A(t) to predict dA/dt
:::

## 

-   Bass (1969) proposed:

$$\frac{dA(t)}{dt}=pR(t)+q\frac{A(t)}{M}R(t)$$

-   $p$ : "coefficient of innovation"

-   $q$ : "coefficient of imitation"

        - p and q assumed constant

::: notes
-   LHS is sales in time period t.
-   R(t) is \# of potential buyers who have not bought yet.
-   p is the share of remaining market who would buy at any given moment
    irrespective of previous sales ("innovators").
-   q is the share of nonadopters who adopt at t because they observe
    past purchasers ("imitators")
-   so qR is the number of nonadopters who adopt at t because they
    observe past purchasers
-   and A/M is the fraction of the market who has adopted, and therefore
    could possibly be observed
-   so we scale qR by A/M because each nonadopter's chance of observing
    an adopter increases with the number of adopters available to be
    observed
:::

## Estimating Bass model via NLLS

$$\frac{dA(t)}{dt}=pR(t)+q\frac{A(t)}{M}R(t)$$

-   This is a first-order diffEQ with analytic solution
    
    $$A(t)=M\frac{1-e^{-(p+q)t}}{1+\frac{q}{p}e^{-(p+q)t}}$$

-   If you have sales data by time, you can use Nonlinear
    Least Squares to estimate $p$, $q$ and $M$, i.e. choosing parameters to
    minimize square errors $(LHS-RHS)^2$

::: notes
-   We state this without proof, because differential equations is not a
    prerequisite, and the solution technique is mechanical and
    uninteresting
:::

## Estimating Bass model via OLS

-   Or, notice that $\frac{dA(t)}{dt}=pR(t)+q\frac{A(t)}{M}R(t)$
    $=p(M-A(t)) + q* \frac{A(t)}{M}(M-A(t))$
    $=pM + (q-p)A(t)-\frac{q}{M} A(t)^2$

-   We can regress $\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$ on a quadratic in installed base

        - Then recover p, q & M from the parameter estimates
        - We'll do both

-   Extensions: Multiple markets, hazard models, <br>types of
    "influence"

## Models:estimators aren't 1:1?

- Consider 3 OLS estimators:

$$\hat{\beta}=(X'X)^{-1}X'Y$$

$$min_\beta (Y-X\beta)'(Y-X\beta)$$

$$min_\beta [X'(Y-X\beta)]^2$$

    "In theory, there's no difference between theory & practice. In practice, there is." 
    Many models offer multiple estimators. Some models have no estimators
    Subfield that studies estimators: "econometrics"

::: notes
- Estimation performance may depend on numerical properties, availability of existing algorithms, etc.
- Estimators may differ in speed, complexity, efficiency and econometric properties
:::



## 

![](images/bass_1969_f5_f8.png){fig-align="center" width="10in"}

::: notes
-   These are two of the graphics from the OG paper. He even forecasted
    sales of black & white TVs
-   I kind of cherry picked these examples. others were not so clean,
    but I'm glad he showed the non-clean examples, it helps to show
    that he didnt cherrypick what to include or not.
-   Think about what an advance this looked like at the time. with just
    a few data points of sales, you could reasonably predict the future,
    which would help to inform investment decisions
-   Important to note: As is typical in predictive analytics, every single prediction is wrong. Keep your expectations in check
:::

## Inspired by epidemiology

![](images/diffusion_curve.png){fig-align="center" width="8in"}

::: notes
-   Distinguish between current and cume sales in the graph
-   Discuss similarities between disease contagion & product adoption
-   Spend a few minutes talking about the phases; mention Moore (1991)'s
    "chasm" or "saddle" idea between initial growth and takeoff
:::

## Which new products will catch on?

![](images/newproducts.png){fig-align="center" width="9in"}

::: notes
Fastest way to get rich: Invent a new product that sells a lot
That requires addressing a real customer need that people will pay for
And it requires going to market successfully 
Success in the market is notoriously hard to predict, most new products fail quickly
Addressing a real core need is necessary but far from sufficient
Which of these new products will succeed?

## Rogers' ACCORD Framework (2003)

-   Diffusion depends on Relative Advantage, Perceived Complexity,
    Compatibility, Observability, Risk, Divisibility (aka
    "Trialability")

        - Summarized 40 years of research, incredibly influential on practice 
        - Provided diagnostics to interpret Bass (1969)'s predictive analytics
        - E.g., a prototype could be evaluated on these 6 dimensions then modified
        - Early example of HARKing but likely useful

## More explanations for diffusion curves

-   Heterogeneity might drive adoption timing

        - Adoption driven by consumer income, need or risk attitudes?

-   Markets typically evolve after introduction

        - Production becomes more efficient, prices and costs fall
        - New features, technology generations, safety improves 
        - Competitors enter and target unserved customers
        - Network effects, e.g. smartphone compatibility with chargers or accessories
        - Complementors, e.g. Verizon stores, iFixIt, Genius Bar
        - Consumer preferences, e.g. reliability matters more with time

::: notes
-   Features: Smartphone cameras improve, GPS improves, 4G beats 2G, etc
-   Complementors: Apps improve, payment processors accept mobile
    payments, etc.
-   Apple drops the headphone jack, Android keeps it
-   Early in a category lifecycle, competitors may benefit each other,
    e.g. ads promote category consumption more than brand share. those
    interactions become zero-sum when the category matures
-   Bass+Rogers is kind of an intellectual trap, where you have a
    logical story and data, and then get blinded to alternate
    explanations

## Customer Lifetime Value

-   CLV is the most powerful customer analytics metric

        - Expresses the firm's value of an individual customer relationship as the net present value of expected future customer profits
        - Pioneered in catalogue retailers in the 1980s
        - Has spread widely, but not yet everywhere
        - CLV metrics enable quantification, and hence serious discussion, of <br>novel policies
        
::: notes
-   Catalogue retailers had huge customer databases, and mailed out
    expensive books multiple times per year. Had to test which customers
    were worth sending books, how often
:::

## CLV Example: Housing First {.scrollable .smaller}

-   "In 2005, Utah set out to fix a problem that's often thought of as
    unfixable: chronic homelessness. The state had almost 2,000
    chronically homeless people. Most of them had mental-health or
    substance-abuse issues, or both. Utah started by just giving the
    homeless homes...
-   The cost of shelters, emergency-room visits, ambulances, police, and
    so on quickly piles up. Lloyd Pendleton, the director of Utah's
    Homeless Task Force ... said that the average chronically homeless
    person used to cost Salt Lake City more than \$20,000/year. Putting
    someone into permanent housing costs the state just \$8,000
    [including case managers]...
-   Utah's first pilot program placed 17 people in homes scattered
    around Salt Lake City, and after twenty-two months not one of them
    was back on the streets. In the years since, the number of Utah's
    chronically homeless has fallen by 74%."

::: notes
-   http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/what-works-albuquerque-homeless-solution-housing-policy-214527
-   I'm not sure your stereotype about utah, but many would not guess
    they invented housing first. It was CLV metrics that showed it to be
    a no-brainer. It's the serious effort to quantify lifetime value
    that moved this from dream to reality. Humanitarian upsides have
    been tremendous.
:::

## Housing First: Looking deeper

-   Housing First has certainly not solved homelessness

        - "Chronic" means disabled and unhoused for 1+ yrs, or 4x in 3 yrs
        - ~28% of CA homelessness is chronic (2019)
        - UT originally claimed 90% reduction, then revised their metric definitions
        - Reliable efficacy metrics are rare    
        - Housing First has been implemented haphazardly
        - UT built new apartments. CA cities mostly use shelters, SROs, vouchers  
        - Key Q: Require wraparound services? E.g. Addiction treatment, etc
        - Key Q: Does Housing First somehow encourage homelessness?

-   I claim: Quantification enables bold policy shifts

        - U.S. HUD adopted Housing First as preferred approach to homelessness in 2014
        - CLV quantifies policy costs and benefits & enables ex-post evaluations
        - We then can use data to refine CLV estimates and policies

::: notes
-   UT annual homeless figures inflate a January count using a
    multiplier
-   Officials changed the multiplier over time but did not revise past
    figures

## Calculating CLV

-   $T$ : planning horizon
-   $m_t$ : contribution margin of serving customer $i$ in time $t$
-   $r$ : retention probability that customer buys in $t+1$
-   $i$ is the cost of capital
-   $CLV=\sum_{t=0}^T\frac{m_t r^t}{(1+i)^t}$
-   $m_t$ and $r$ observable in past data; future values are predictions

::: notes
-   Often set arbitrarily at T=3 years, but Bezos says Amazon's 7-year
    horizon lets them amortize and justify investments that competitors
    can't match
-   $m_t$ and should depend on future firm strategy and market
    conditions
-   Extensible to model purchase frequency, basket size, profitability
-   Heterogeneity: $m$ and $r$ often vary across cohorts and segments,
    but we'll disregard that for simplicity
:::

## CLV Example {.scrollable .smaller}

-   A tennis club charges an annual fee of \$300
-   The average club member spends \$100 a year at the club
    (concessions, etc.)
-   The average contribution margin on these additional expenditures is
    60%
-   Historically, 80% of the members rejoin the club in any given year.
    The club's cost of capital is 15%
-   What is the club's CLV over a 1-year horizon?
    <!-- # m=300+.6\*100=360, i=.15, r=.8 ::: notes ::: - CLV(1yr)=360-->
-   What is the club's avg. CLV over a 2-year horizon?
    <!-- # CLV(2yr)=360+360\*.8/1.15=610.43 -->
-   What is the club's avg. CLV over a 3-year horizon?\
    <!-- # CLV(3yr)=360(1+.8/1.15+.64/1.3225)=784.65 -->

::: notes
-   Notice how quickly avg. CLV starts to asymptote as T grows large
-   is i=.15 realistic? yes-- business payday loans industry like
    mulligan funding
:::

## Using CLV for Customer Acquisition

-   Marketing campaigns should be profitable if Avg. Customer
    Acquisition Cost (CAC) $<$ CLV

        - Caveat: So long as acquired customers have CLV>=avg CLV of existing customers
        - Often, managers impose a "fudge factor" as a speedbump

-   Suppose the tennis club has a chance to pay \$20k for a billboard.
    It will be seen by 100K people with an expected conversion rate of
    .1%. Should we do it?

```{=html}
<!-- # CAC=20K/(.001\*100k)=20k/100=200. Profitable even on a 1-yr horizon.
    yes in a vaccum; but more realistically, how confident are we in
    that .1% conversion prediction? can we get our money back if the ad
    performs poorly? do we have better ways to spend the \$20k? -->
```
-   Similar "break-even" calculations possible for

        - partnerships, opening new stores, price promotions, etc. Anything that requires an upfront outlay to potentially acquire new customers, increase current customer retention, or develop current customer spending

::: notes
-   Common fudge factors: 3, 7. Why?
:::

## CLV Metrics in Practice

-   CLV popularity rose alongside CRM data systems

        - e.g. Oracle, SAP, Salesforce
        - Services and retailers used CLV to set customer experiences: high-CLV flyers got upgraded, high-CLV lodgers got better rooms, high-CLV shoppers got sterling return service and attention, high-CLV callers got shorter wait times and more consideration

-   In the 00s, consulting firms published claims that 20-30% of
    customers were unprofitable. Many firms tried to "fire" unprofitable
    customers

        - American Express offered some cardholders $300 to cancel their cards. Best Buy stopped notifying some shoppers about upcoming promotions. Banks used minimum balances and teller fees to drive away some accountholders

-   Customers talk to each other; firing customers is a brand risk

::: notes
-   In other words, line up all the customers from most profitable to
    least profitable, and the bottom 20% or more would show
    negative CLV. If true, then you immediately increase your profit by
    dropping your bottom 20% of customers. Note, this is very simplistic
    thinking; maybe prices are too low or return policies are too
    generous?

## CLV Cautions & Risks

-   CRM data may be incomplete, disconnected, error prone

        - E.g., can you connect customer identity across different credit card #s?
        - Think about measurement error in retention rate

-   CLV models are typically misspecified & uncertain

        - CLV-based policies may be self-fulfilling
        - Treat someone as unprofitable, they may act that way      

-   Guiding Principle

        - The firm and the customer share an interest in creating an optimum level of customer value. Using CLV metrics for value creation benefits everyone
        - The firm and the customer have opposing interests in price. Using CLV for margin extraction creates perverse incentives for customers
        - Customer dissatisfaction may reveal CLV flaws; requires careful attention
        - Hence many firms now measure point-of-sale satisfaction

::: notes
-   Think about the retention measurement error this could cause, and
    the dramatic change in CLV
-   POS satisfaction: e.g. NPS or those "smiley face" 1-button
    indicators. Try to detect issues faster before they affect customer
    relationships.
-   This frontier is actively moving
